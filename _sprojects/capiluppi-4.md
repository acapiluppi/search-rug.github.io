---

Create a model based on data from soil moisture sensors. Using this dataset, you will create a model that determines when irrigation has taken place. Using this data, we can help farmers worldwide reduce the use of water to grow crops. So be a part of CropX Europe and make farming more sustainable and minimize the use of inputs while maximizing yields.
